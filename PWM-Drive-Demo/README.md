# Bitty Bot

Code for the Bitty Bot Rover.

## Installation

Nothing Special Needed for this code

## Usage

Demo of PWM vs time for the Bitty Bot

1st it will move forward very slow for about 1 second, pause
and go backward quickly for about 1 second. Demo the distance
that can be traveled both slowly and quickly.

2nd it will keep the speed the same, but change the time
Go forward for about 2 seconds (quickly/medium speed), pause
Go backward for about 1 second (quickly/medium speed), pause

there is a long delay between looping, the cycle will repeat.

This is a testing branch and things are bound to change over time, PIN numbers may or may not be the same at the end of testing.
